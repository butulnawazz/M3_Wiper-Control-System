Introduction

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper

What is wiper control?
Wiper Controls  have a low and a high speed, as well as an intermittent setting. When the wipers are on low and high speed, the motor runs continuously. But in the intermittent setting, the wipers stop momentarily between each wipe.

Why wiper system is useful in the automotive unit?
Windscreen wiper is essential for keeping the windscreen sufficiently clean for driver's visibility specifically for modern high speed vehicles. The washer cleans the driver's side of the windscreen whenever required. Each motor vehicle is equipped with an audible warning device.

Where are the wiper controls?
Image result for where  is wiper control system used
Generally speaking, windshield wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of your steering wheel.

Which is the most commonly used wiper in all motor vehicle?
Pivot/radial Wiper: The blade for this windscreen wiper is secured to a single arm which is attached to the motor. It is the most commonly used and hence, it is found in most cars.

How many types of wipers are there?
Different types of wipers
The three main types of wiper blades are: conventional, flat and hybrid. If your car came with conventional windscreen wipers, they can be replaced with flat or hybrid wipers for a performance and visual upgrade.

SWOT

Strenght

Operating principle is very easy.
It consumes less power for operation.
Installation of rain sensor based systems are very much simple.

Weakness

The rain sensor based system functions when water falls on the sensor directly.
The cost of overall system increases as additional components are needed along with rain sensor.
In order to avoid false detection of rain, it requires rain sensors to take decision after few minutes.

Opportunities

It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains. This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption.
It extends life of rain sensor based systems such as car wiper, irrigation systems by running them only when it is necessary.

Threats

Why do wiper blades fail?
Sun, heat, cold, time, debris, and use will cause blades to wear/dry out causing performance issues. Cheap discount wipers/old wipers may not flex properly to todays modern curved windshields or the wiping surface deteriorates or cheap materials will cause an unsafe environment when you to depend on it most.
