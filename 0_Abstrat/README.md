INTRODUCTION

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper

A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.
The control system includes a rain sensor  detecting rain conditions to produce .
an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions. The analog sensor signal is converted into a digital pulse signal
by a converter  for application to a digital circuit system. A control signal is produced by digitally processing the pulse signal.
The control signal is applied to a wiper driver circuit to adjust the operational speed or timing in accordance with the control signal.

Automatic Wiper works in modern cars. Here you can get an idea on the CAN Bus which is used in the Communication of Sensors, Actuators and controllers in a car.

The CAN Protocol is in view of a bus topology, and just two wires are required for Communication over a CAN bus. 
The bus has a multi-master structure where every device on the bus can send or get information. Any device can send information while 
every one of the others should listen. In the event that two or more devices endeavour to send information in the meantime,
the one with the highest priority is permitted to send its information while the others come back to receive mode.
